Type Definitions for Morphological Source Code.

These type definitions establish the foundational elements of the MSC framework, 
enabling the representation of various constructs as first-class citizens.

- T: Represents Type structures (static).
- V: Represents Value spaces (dynamic).
- C: Represents Computation spaces (transformative).

The relationships between these types are crucial for maintaining the 
nominative invariance across transformations.

1. **Identity Preservation (T)**: The type structure remains consistent across transformations.
2. **Content Preservation (V)**: The value space is dynamically maintained, allowing for fluid data manipulation.
3. **Behavioral Preservation (C)**: The computation space is transformative, enabling the execution of operations that modify the state of the system.

Homoiconism dictates that, upon runtime validation, all objects are code and data. 
To facilitate this, we utilize first-class functions and a static typing system.

This maps perfectly to the three aspects of nominative invariance:

- Identity preservation, T: Type structure (static)
- Content preservation, V: Value space (dynamic)
- Behavioral preservation, C: Computation space (transformative)

[[T (Type) ↔ V (Value) ↔ C (Callable)]] == 'quantum infodynamics, a tripartite element; our Particle()(s)'

Meta-Language (High Level)
  ↓ [First Collapse - Compilation]
Intermediate Form (Like a quantum superposition)
  ↓ [Second Collapse - Runtime]
Executed State (Measured Reality)

What's conserved across these transformations:

- Nominative relationships
- Information content
- Causal structure
- Computational potential

The type system forms the "boundary" theory.
The runtime forms the "bulk" theory.

The homoiconic property ensures they encode the same information. The holoiconic property enables:

- States as quantum superpositions
- Computations as measurements
- Types as boundary conditions
- Runtime as bulk geometry

Python objects are implemented as C structures.

```c
typedef struct _object {
    Py_ssize_t ob_refcnt;
    PyTypeObject *ob_type;
} PyObject;
```

Everything in Python is an object, and every object has a type. 
The type of an object is a class. Even the type class itself is an instance of type. 
Functions defined within a class become method objects when accessed through an instance of the class.

Functions are instances of the function class.
Methods are instances of the method class (which wraps functions).
Both function and method are subclasses of object.

Homoiconism dictates the need for a way to represent all Python constructs as first-class citizens (fcc):

- Functions
- Classes
- Control structures
- Operations
- Primitive values

"""
Nominative "true OOP" (SmallTalk) and my specification demands code as data and value as logic, structure.

The Particle(), our polymorph of object and fcc-apparent at runtime, always represents the literal source code
which makes up their logic and possesses the ability to be stateful source code data structure.

Homoiconistic morphological source code displays 'modified quine' behavior
within a validated runtime, if and only if the valid Python interpreter
has r/w/x permissions to the source code file and some method of writing
state to the source code file is available.

Any interruption of the `__exit__` method or misuse of `__enter__` will result in a runtime error.

"""
AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance, with lazy/halting consistentcy):

A system that prioritizes availability and partition tolerance may use a distributed architecture with eventual consistency (e.g., Cassandra or Riak).
This ensures that the system is always available (availability), even in the presence of network partitions (partition tolerance).
However, the system may sacrifice consistency, as nodes may have different views of the data (no consistency).

A homoiconic piece of source code is eventually consistent, assuming it is able to be re-instantiated.
