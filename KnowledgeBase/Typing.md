Type Definitions for Morphological Source Code.

The framework establishes a tripartite system that mirrors quantum field dynamics:

1. Type Structure (T) - Static Identity Layer:
   - Maintains structural integrity across transformations
   - Enforces nominative invariance
   - Acts as the boundary condition for quantum states
   - Example: DataType, AtomType enums

2. Value Space (V) - Dynamic State Layer:
   - Represents quantum superpositions of possible states
   - Holds mutable data in probabilistic fields
   - Enables emergence through state evolution
   - Bound by: Union[int, float, str, bool, list, dict, tuple, set, object, Callable, type]

3. Computation Space (C) - Transformative Layer:
   - Functions as the thermodynamic head/Maxwell's Demon
   - Facilitates morphological transformations
   - Triggers holoiconic collapse of quantum states
   - Bound by: Callable[..., Any]

The relationships form a closed loop:
    T (Static Type) → V (Dynamic Value) → C (Transform) → T
    
This maps to quantum informatics through:
    - Type Structure = Boundary Theory (static constraints)
    - Value Space = Bulk Theory (quantum superposition)
    - Computation Space = Collapse Operator (measurement/transformation)

When an Atom() is instantiated, it exists simultaneously as:
    1. A static type structure (T) that preserves identity
    2. A quantum superposition of possible values (V)
    3. A set of potential transformations (C)

The holoiconic property ensures information conservation across all three layers,
while the thermodynamic aspects govern the energy costs of state transitions
and transformations.

"""
Type Definitions for Morphological Source Code.

The framework establishes a tripartite type system that mirrors quantum field theoretical 
principles through three interconnected spaces:

1. Type Structure (T):
   - Represents the static, boundary-defining aspect of the system
   - Maintains identity preservation across transformations
   - Acts as the "boundary theory" in the bulk/boundary correspondence
   - TypeVar bound to any, establishing universal type constraints

2. Value Space (V):
   - Represents the dynamic, state-holding aspect of the system
   - Maintains content preservation during transformations
   - Bound to concrete types (int, float, str, etc.)
   - Functions as the "bulk theory" storage of actual data states

3. Computation Space (C):
   - Represents the transformative, operational aspect of the system
   - Maintains behavioral preservation during execution
   - Bound to Callable[..., Any], enabling first-class function interfaces
   - Facilitates the morphological transformations between T and V

The relationship between these spaces forms a closed loop of preservation:
- T → V: Identity preservation ensures type consistency
- V → C: Content preservation enables stateful transformations
- C → T: Behavioral preservation maintains system integrity

This tripartite structure enables:
- Quantum-like superposition of states in the Value space
- Measurement-like operations in the Computation space
- Boundary condition enforcement in the Type space

The system maintains homoiconicity through the Atom() wrapper, which can represent
any Python object while preserving all three aspects of nominative invariance:
identity (T), content (V), and behavior (C).
