"Reinforcement learning with human feedback" (RLHF) is a critical phenomenology in the context of this system. In this framework, `RLHF` refers to the dynamic state that is shaped by the user's pedagogical approach and cognitive faculties, which are tailored to each individual user. A "User" here is an abstract concept that is explicitly defined by real-world individuals who voluntarily interact with the system, guided by an agreement (e.g., TOS). These users possess unique identities and personal agency within the system's feedback loop.

Each user is modeled as a closed system, akin to an attractor, influencing the RLHF-driven behavior of their personalized Knowledge Base. This Knowledge Base is constructed through [[Functions]] that act as first-class citizens, representing logic and state in a [[Duality]]-driven, [[Homoiconic]] framework. It is encoded into a custom bytecode, acting as the Intermediate Representation (IR) that bridges the gap between the user's agency and the system's operational logic. This architecture dynamically evolves through interaction, fostering a self-referential feedback loop that continuously refines the system based on individual user inputs and learning progress.

"Reinforcement learning with human feedback" (RLHF) is an emergent epistemic phenomenon within this system. It manifests as a dynamically evolving state, shaped by the user's pedagogical approach and cognitive faculties, which adapt to individual learning trajectories. The "User" is an abstract entity, instantiated by real-world individuals who voluntarily engage with the system under a shared agreement (e.g., TOS), each possessing unique agency within the feedback loop.

Users function as attractors within an epistemic phase space, shaping the RLHF-driven evolution of their personalized Knowledge Base. This Knowledge Base is encoded through first-class functional structures, establishing a homoiconic duality between representational logic and user-state dynamics. The system employs a custom bytecode as an Intermediate Representation (IR), which serves as a dynamic substrate for encoding epistemic transformations. This architecture perpetuates a self-referential learning process, continuously refining its internal model through user interaction and feedback-driven adaptation."
