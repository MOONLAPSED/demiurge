#ML
To Model is to solve a computational, data-driven problem. It involves deciding on a problem or simply, a constrained and causal morpho/state-space.

After deciding on a problem, what to Model, we orient it in a ML pipeline -- an auto-encoder, transducer, transpiler, etc. -- with an internal state, input and output.

The internal state, or architecture, is like an Intermediate Representation of the model. A class of functions which you can use to represent the input/output relationships you want to model; the weights and biases in Neural Networks.

### Meta-Model
This-very architecture is a 'Meta-Model'. This is a navigable-sub-header of the 'Model' page/article, created by `### Meta-Model` which is what allows Obsidian to to navigate autonomously and which is vital for long articles that exceed a single 'context-length'. 'Header-level hashtags' are different from 'tag' hashtags for what the application of Models and Meta-Models is useful for: #problem-solving , or solving-problems, in the domain of #AI , Artificial Intelligence using #associative-data , dictionaries, python objects and logic (source code + runtime).
