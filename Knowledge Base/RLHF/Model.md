To Model is to solve a computational, data-driven problem. It involves deciding on a problem or simply, a constrained and causal morpho/state-space.

After deciding on a problem, what to Model, we orient it in a ML pipeline -- an auto-encoder, transducer, transpiler, etc. -- with an internal state, input and output.

The internal state, or architecture, is like an Intermediate Representation of the model. A class of functions which you can use to represent the input/output relationships you want to model; the weights and biases in Neural Networks.
