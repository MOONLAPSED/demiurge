### The Ontology of Actions

The ontology of objects assumes that there are elementary objects, called “particles,” out of which all more complex objects—and therefore the whole of reality—are constituted. Similarly, the ontology of relational agency assumes that there are elementary processes, which I will call **actions** or **reactions**, that form the basic constituents of reality (Heylighen 2011; Heylighen and Beigi 2018; Turchin 1993). 

A rationale for the primacy of processes over matter can be found in **quantum field theory** (Bickhard 2011; Kuhlmann 2000). Quantum mechanics has shown that observing some phenomenon, such as the position of a particle, is an action that necessarily affects the phenomenon being observed: **no observation without interaction**. Moreover, the result of that observation is often indeterminate before the observation is made. The action of observing, in a real sense, creates the property being observed through a process known as the **collapse of the wave function** (Heylighen 2019; Tumulka 2006). 

For example:
- Before observation, a particle (e.g., an electron) typically does not have a precise position in space.
- Immediately after observation, the particle assumes a precise position.

More generally, quantum mechanics tells us that:
- Microscopic objects, such as particles, do not have objective, determinate properties.
- Such properties are (temporarily) generated through interaction (Barad 2003).

Quantum field theory expands on this, asserting that:
- **Objects (particles)** themselves do not have permanent existence.
- They can be created or destroyed through interactions, such as nuclear reactions.
- Particles can even be generated by **vacuum fluctuations** (Milonni 2013), though such particles are so transient that they are called “virtual.”

#### Processes in Living Organisms and Ecosystems

At larger scales:
- Molecules in living organisms are ephemeral, produced and broken down by the chemical reactions of metabolism.
- Cells and organelles are in constant flux, undergoing processes like **apoptosis** and **autophagy**, while new cells are formed through **cell division** and **stem cell differentiation**.

In ecosystems:
- Processes such as **predation**, **symbiosis**, and **reproduction** interact with **meteorological** and **geological forces** to produce constantly changing landscapes of forests, rivers, mountains, and meadows.

Even at planetary and cosmic scales:
- The Earth's crust and mantle are in flux, with magma moving continents and forming volcanoes.
- The Sun and stars are boiling cauldrons of nuclear reactions, generating new elements in their cores while releasing immense amounts of energy.

### Actions, Reactions, and Agencies

In this framework:
- **Condition-action rules** can be interpreted as reactions:
  
  `{a, b, …} → {e, f, …}`

This represents an **elementary process** where:
- The conditions on the left ({a, b, …}) act as inputs.
- These inputs transform into the conditions on the right ({e, f, …}), which are the outputs (Heylighen, Beigi, and Veloz 2015).

#### Definition of Agency

Agencies (**A**) can be defined as **necessary conditions** for the occurrence of a reaction. However, agencies themselves are not directly affected by the reaction:

`A + X → A + Y`

Here:
- The reaction between **A**, **X**, and **Y** can be reinterpreted as an **action** performed by agency **A** on condition **X** to produce condition **Y**.
- This can be represented in shorter notation as:

`A: X → Y`

#### Dynamic Properties of Agencies

While an agency remains invariant during the reactions it catalyzes:
- There exist reactions that **create** (produce) or **destroy** (consume) that agency.

Thus, agencies are:
- Neither inert nor invariant.
- They catalyze multiple reactions and respond dynamically to different conditions:

`A: X → Y, Y → Z, U → Z`


This set of actions triggered by **A** can be interpreted as a **dynamical system**, mapping initial states (e.g., X, Y, U) onto subsequent states (e.g., Y, Z, Z) (Heylighen 2022; Sternberg 2010).
