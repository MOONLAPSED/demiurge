# to zettel is to notate, save to memory/datastructure/disc and apply meta-data to an input/signal/transmission to conform with the 'Zettelkasten' method of note-taking.

"""empty directories imported as packages are not empty, they contain __path__ and __file__ attributes, and the __path__ attribute is a list of strings that are the paths to the directories that are in the package, and the __file__ attribute is the path to the __init__.py file in the package. __spec__ is the module spec that is used to load the module, and __loader__ is the loader that is used to load the module. __package__ is the name of the package that the module is in, and __name__ is the name of the module. __doc__ is the docstring of the module, and __path__ is the path to the module. __file__ is the path to the file that the module was loaded from.

# python packaging is a clever additional layer of meta-data if compiled into the module, and naming conventions are to be be evocative and self-explanatory in 'imports' and in source code with runtime being tertiary in-terms of variable and architecture naming conventions.

'in other words, write PRETTY and pythonic, perhaps even overly verbose source code as a way to make the code more readable and more easily understood by others, and to make the code more easily understood by the bot and the user. Source code is genetically iterated using fuzzing + harnesses and best practices and heuristics, which allow for effective collaboration between various ai chatbot agent and LLM based applications, functions, modules, and libs, and the underlying platforms shell or in commits and versioning.'
