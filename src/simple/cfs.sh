cpfs_path="/path/to/cpfs"

# Initial metadata-only copy (using rsync for efficiency)
rsync -avz --no-o --no-g --info=progress2 "$hostfs_vault_path/" "$cpfs_path/"

# Explanation of rsync flags:
#   -a: Archive mode (preserve metadata)
#   -v: Verbose output
#   -z: Compress (optional, might slow things down with small files)
#   --no-o: Don't preserve owner
#   --no-g: Don't preserve group
#   --info=progress2: Show progress

# ... Logic for in-situ content replacement within files on 'hostfs' would go here
#     (using tools like sed or your Python script from previous examples)


# Forked Copy (cpfs): The creation of a dynamically generated cpfs that serves as a mutable workspace derived from the original file system.

# A module for surgical replacement of elements within files of a directory tree,
# and creating a forked copy in the process.

# * cpfs (copy file-system): A mutable copy generated at run-time, serving as the
#    basis for modifications.
# * hfs (host file-system): The original file system.
#     * File Structure: Immutable.
#     * Metadata: Immutable (except for unavoidable OS-level modifications).
#     * File Contents: Minimally mutable. Acceptable changes must be confined to single-line
#        statements representing UTF-8 path strings (as used by Obsidian for links).
# * Target Elements:  Obsidian-generated path/link strings within files.
